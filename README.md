# **Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)**

**Fish farms** are critical to global fish production but face challenges such as pollution, disease, and fish escapes. This project develops a **Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)** to address these challenges in open aquaculture operations. The ROV employs **IoT technology** for remote control and monitoring, utilizing MQTT for communication.
